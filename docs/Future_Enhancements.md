## First: Deploy to Web
GreenPlate is a vegetarian and vegan recipe app built with React and Vite. It allows users to browse recipes filtered by meal time (breakfast, lunch, snack, dinner) and diet type (vegetarian, vegan).

## Second: Address Key Architecture Improvements
Once deployed, but before mobile conversion:
- Extract the filter logic into custom hooks
- Improve state management if needed
- Fix any performance issues that appear in production

## Areas for Improvement

### State Management Complexity
App.jsx is handling a lot of state logic.
Consider

- Moving filter logic to custom hooks (useRecipeFilters)
- Creating a useRecipeSearch hook
- Using Context API for shared state if the app grows

### File Organization
Some suggestions

```
src/
  ├── hooks/          # Custom hooks
  ├── utils/          # Helper functions
  ├── constants/      # App constants
  ├── pages/          # Page components
  └── features/       # Feature-based folders
```

### Recipe Data Structure

- Consider normalizing the data (separate ingredients table)
- Add categories, tags, or difficulty levels
- Consider TypeScript for better type safety

### Component Coupling

- The filter components could be more generic
- Consider a higher-order component for filters
- Abstract the filtering logic into utility functions

## Specific Architectural Suggestions

### Extract Filter Logic

```jsx
// hooks/useRecipeFilters.js
export const useRecipeFilters = (recipes) => {
  // Move all filtering logic here
};

```
### Create Feature Folders

```
src/features/
  ├── recipes/
  │   ├── RecipeCard.jsx
  │   ├── RecipeDetail.jsx
  │   └── hooks/
  ├── filters/
  │   ├── DietFilter.jsx
  │   └── IngredientFilter.jsx
```

### Consider Route-Based Code Splitting

```jsx
import { lazy, Suspense } from 'react';

const RecipeDetail = lazy(() => import('./components/recipe/RecipeDetail'));

```

## Finally: Mobile App Conversion
With a working, tested web app:

- Use React Native or a wrapper like Capacitor/Cordova to convert
- Adapt the UI for mobile-specific interactions
- Handle offline capabilities.
